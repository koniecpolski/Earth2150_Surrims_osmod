## Fixed scripts ##

All scripts are improved from the original and partially much more powerful.

### Unit scripts ###

- Based on profi scripts

- Modes "Default", "Lights off" and "Hold postition"

- Cleanup ruins/walls feature

- Builder is much faster also on executing recorded commands and building walls

- Pressing "L" for lights mode works for all units

- Repairers can Auto-Upgrade units and Buildings

### Destroy enemy structures ###

- Timer

- Multilanguage support (Language.wd is used)

- Auto-Ally after 12 seconds (teams by distance, request in a team by random, only watchers or ai will be asked, also possible: 2v3, 1v1v1 or 1v14)

- Explored map for watchers

- More intelligent AI (teamplay, attacking priorities)

- Killed players can't rebuild, everything will be destroyed after 5 seconds

- XL mode (more ressoures)

- Endless resorces mode (disables also trenching and walls)

- Uncle Sam mode (15,000-40,000 CR/min)

- Techwar money mode (1,000,000,000 CR)

- 1x-8x research speed, Alien mode (endless speed) and TechWar mode

- Playable with default map units and buildings

- Restrictable to small units or no air

- Many smaller optimizations

### Bots / AI ###

- Improved builder script to build much more buildings

- Ressurecting capability

- No stupid researches like earthquakes and SDI

- TDBot (black magic bot)

## OperationX v7 settings ##

This mod is uses OperationX units and buildings. Translations are used from the original where it was possible. New OPX units have only english names.

## Fixed executable ##

OSMod uses a separate directory for user profiles. That's a good thing to avoid corrupt units in the construction dialog.

Pressing enter on the main menu leads to multiplayer and accepts ally requests by default.
